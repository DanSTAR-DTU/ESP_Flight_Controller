## STRUCTURE
The drivers for the individual components and features of the ESP resides in the "drivers"-folder.
The actual logic and flight controller code resides in the "src"-folder

## SETUP
You need to generate a sdkconfig for the ESP as this contains locations of files on the individual computer.
Editor-preferences should also be generated on the individual machines.
